# RetroX7

RetroX7 is a simple installer and updater for a cloud-based retro gaming environment. With it, you can easily install all the necessary tools to play your favorite retro games in a centralized way, without any hassle.

## Features

- Automatically installs **Retrobat**, **WinFsp** and other essential tools for retro gaming.  
- Configures all **ROMs and ISOs** in a centralized folder on your computer.  
- Keeps your retro gaming setup **automatically up-to-date**.  
- Allows access to a **retro game streaming service** using credentials (coming soon, via a website with online checkout and free trial).  
- Includes an **intelligent cache system**, which stores parts of the game in memory to reduce stuttering in future sessions.  

## How to use

1. **Download the installer**: `RetroX7-Installer.bat`.  
2. **Run the installer** on your computer.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions and install all requested tools.  
4. At the end, a **shortcut will be created on your desktop**.  
5. Click the shortcut, enter your credentials (acquired during purchase and received via your email) and start playing.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or higher  
- **Stable internet connection**, with a minimum download speed of 10 MB (~1 MB/s).  
  - For a smoother experience, a **100 MB internet connection (~5 MB/s)** is recommended, since games are streamed.

## Notes about the testing phase

- The project is still in **testing phase**, so the server is limited.  
- During high traffic periods, upload speed may be restricted, causing **possible stuttering in games**.  
- The **streaming system has an intelligent cache**:  
  - When you play a game, the system stores parts of it in memory cache.  
  - If stuttering occurs due to download speed, those already cached areas **will not need to be downloaded again**, making future sessions more stable.  
  - All of this happens **automatically**, without any user intervention.  
- Soon, the website will be launched with **online checkout and free trial**, making it easier to access the service.
